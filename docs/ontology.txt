spek ontology
-------------

hok: collection of subhoks and razas and marks and bods and gaps with 1 or more joints to connect to other hoks

raza: plane collecting marks on which they can relate to each other and prams

mark: point, line or arc collected by 1 or more razas

bod: positive envelope of mechanical part defined by flaating a series of razas

gap: area within a bod with distinct properties (ie a solid support, conductive, a hole) defined by scooping a series of razas

pram: constraint, relation or parameter affecting marks on a raza

joint: interface that geometry external to hok can relate to

mod: hok elevated to a type with instances

foal: instance of a mod, can have custom local properties that override global mod
